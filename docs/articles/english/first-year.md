# My First Year as a Frontend Developer: Time Management Tips
___

In my first year working as a frontend developer, I completed hundreds of tasks. Some of them were done in the evenings, some were done at the weekends and some tasks were done after deadlines.

Starting my second year, I noticed that my planning got better. Finally, I could close my work laptop and relax in front of my home desktop. I will explain how it became possible.

## Take your time

Saying that I would complete a 4-hour task in two hours never impressed anyone but almost always made me work overtime. Fear of telling a longer estimated time leads to failed deadlines. Failed deadlines lead to resentment from the team.

The slower but predictable developer is much better for teamwork than the unpredictable one. Even if sometimes they, in fact, complete tasks in the underestimated time.

Don’t underestimate tasks.

## Give yourself a deadline to ask for help

There were times when I spent half of my day without any significant result. I was scared to ask for help and therefore to let my mentor know that I wasted a few hours. And then I spent another half of the day trying to solve the same problem, finally asked for help and had to admit that I wasted the whole day.

Give yourself a deadline that will help you understand when it’s time to get help. And remember that admitting your problems to the senior developer is much better than giving yourself excuses in front of your whole team at the next daily meeting.

## Show what you’ve done

When you go to your mentor with some questions about a task, be ready for their questions:

What have you tried?
What exactly couldn't you do?
How have you tried to solve the problem?

Don’t be afraid to show non-working code. It will prove that you’ve searched for a solution.

## Good and fast beats perfect and slow

Some programmers think that their job is to solve problems in the most exciting way. These programmers often bruise their ego by having to meet deadlines.

If you need a couple of days to write your own component, but you can achieve the same result in two hours by using a popular library, use your common sense.

Good programmers understand that their job is to solve problems in a reasonable time.

## Track your time even if you’re not asked to

When I started, my job didn’t ask me to track my task time. Until they did. And I had no idea how to estimate tasks other than "when it's done, it's done".

Even if you are not asked, track your time, so you can plan your work in the future.

## Decompose until it’s clear

The senior developers that I worked with could estimate tasks surprisingly well. Unlike me, they understood what they needed to do.

I knew that I could only evaluate small tasks. I came to a very meticulous style of describing things that I have to do. Sometimes my subtasks are just 15-20 minutes long, but it helps to  plan more accurately.

Even if you don’t have to decompose your tasks in the task manager, create a step-by-step plan in a notebook. Plus, you can run this list by your mentor if you have some doubts about the plan.

## Task description can be wrong

In one of my latest tasks, our designer combined two already existing form fields into one. I knew that to change these fields I have to rewrite styles, tests, validations, serializers and at the same time try not to break forms that should work the old way. This would take a lot of my and our testers’ time, but it seemed completely useless.

I wasn’t sure about all of that, so I asked if it’s really necessary. It turned out the product owner had no idea why the designer did it. My estimated task time was reduced by 90%.

If something seems unnecessary but will take a lot of time, ask about it. It could be a simple mistake.

## Don’t rush to close your pull requests

If you're not sure about someone's comments in code review, ask about it. If you think that these comments are not entirely reasonable, ask about it. Don't just apply something because you need to finish it quickly. Besides, sometimes the senior developer can be wrong. It will not happen much, but there is some chance of it.

If you apply changes without questioning them, you will learn nothing, and it will be a bad experience both for you and your reviewer.
